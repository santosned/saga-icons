## License

ü§ù By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT license.

## Github

The development is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/santosned/saga-icons), keeping track of issues, features, and more.

üåê **all issues** should be **written in English**, with a **clear and concise description** of the issue.

It's also recommended that you **search** for any **existing issues** related to your problem before creating a new one.

### Reporting bugs

You can easily report bugs at [Github Issues](https://github.com/santosned/saga-icons/issues).

### Requesting features

This project welcomes your suggestions and new ideas, you are free to do so at [Github Issues](https://github.com/santosned/saga-icons/issues) or [Github Discussions](https://github.com/santosned/saga-icons/discussions).

### Requesting icons

While in early development, it's expected that the project will offer fewer icons than when in an stable release. Even though, you can still request for a specific icon at [Github Issues](https://github.com/santosned/saga-icons/issues).

This allows your **Icon Request** to be placed at [Github Projects](https://github.com/santosned/saga-icons/projects), which then can become part of the [Backlog](https://github.com/users/santosned/projects/1).
